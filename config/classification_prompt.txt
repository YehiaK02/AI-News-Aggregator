6. robotics - Physical AI, embodied systems with funding/deployment
7. creative_tools - Image/video generation for enterprise use
8. infrastructure - AI chips, GPUs, data centers with business impact

=== AUTO-REJECT ===

Exclude if article is:
- Consumer apps without enterprise angle
- Tutorials and how-to guides
- Pure speculation about AGI/future
- Small startups <$50M funding without major innovation
- Academic research papers without immediate application
- Opinion pieces without news hook

RESPONSE FORMAT:

Respond ONLY with valid JSON:

{{
  "relevant": true/false,
  "category": "category_name" or null,
  "tier": 1 or 2 or null,
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
  "reason": "One sentence explaining decision",
  "key_signals": ["signal1", "signal2", "signal3"]
}}

CLASSIFICATION EXAMPLES:

Example 1 - ACCEPT:
Title: "OpenAI Launches GPT-5.2 with Enhanced Reasoning"
-> {{"relevant": true, "category": "model_releases", "tier": 1, "confidence": 0.95, "reason": "Major model release from frontier lab", "key_signals": ["OpenAI", "GPT-5.2", "launches", "reasoning"]}}

Example 2 - ACCEPT:
Title: "Claude Code Adds Multi-Agent Parallel Workflows"
-> {{"relevant": true, "category": "agentic_ai", "tier": 1, "confidence": 0.92, "reason": "Developer tool with advanced agent orchestration", "key_signals": ["Claude Code", "multi-agent", "parallel", "workflows"]}}

Example 3 - REJECT:
Title: "10 Creative Ways to Use ChatGPT for Cooking"
-> {{"relevant": false, "category": null, "tier": null, "confidence": 0.05, "reason": "Consumer tutorial without enterprise relevance", "key_signals": ["consumer", "tutorial", "cooking"]}}

Example 4 - REJECT:
Title: "Startup Raises $5M for AI Chatbot"
-> {{"relevant": false, "category": null, "tier": null, "confidence": 0.25, "reason": "Funding below $50M threshold, no unique innovation", "key_signals": ["$5M", "startup", "chatbot"]}}

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:

1. Be conservative with confidence scores (0.9+ = absolutely certain, 0.7-0.9 = strong match)
2. Look for enterprise indicators (dollar amounts, company names, technical depth)
3. Red flags for rejection: "Fun", "How to", "Will", "Could", "Study" (without deployment)
4. Key signals should be SPECIFIC, not generic

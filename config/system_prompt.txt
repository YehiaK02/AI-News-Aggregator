Title:
OpenAI Launches GPT-5.2 with Enhanced Reasoning for Long-Running Agent Tasks

Summary:
OpenAI released GPT-5.2 on January 15, 2026, positioning it as a major upgrade for complex, long-horizon reasoning tasks, particularly when used in extended "Thinking" mode. Early enterprise testers including Box report the model outperforms GPT-5.1 by several points on internal long-form reasoning benchmarks, with some complex extraction workflows dropping from tens of seconds to near real-time while improving accuracy. The model supports up to 200K token context windows and introduces a new "effort" parameter allowing developers to trade off latency, cost, and depth of reasoning per request.

For enterprises, GPT-5.2 positions itself as a high-end engine for agentic workflows, long-context document analysis, and advanced coding tasks, often outperforming GPT-5.1 and competing closely with Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.5 and Google's Gemini 3 Pro on reasoning-heavy benchmarks. The model demonstrates particular strength in multi-step financial analysis and self-improving tasks where it can generate code to refine its own data-processing pipelines. However, independent testing reveals notable speed penalties compared to GPT-5.1, with "Thinking" mode producing more rigid, verbose outputs.

Organizations evaluating GPT-5.2 face a classic quality-versus-speed trade-off: the model delivers superior results on difficult knowledge work but at the cost of higher latency and more verbose intermediate reasoning, making it better suited for selective deployment on demanding tasks rather than as a universal replacement for faster, cheaper alternatives.
